# mremoteng_password_decrypter
This decrypt function was ripped out of another project which no longer works.

I'm not really going to invest any time into this so feel free to fork and do whatever, I'll also take pulls.

You can get your mremoteNG passwords from the confCons.xml file in C:/Users/$username/AppData/Roaming/mRemoteNG
Then edit the python file to include your hash and run it
